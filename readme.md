<h2>CloverTrainerUtils Documentation</h2>


<h3>Introduction</h3>


<p>
In Pixelmon Reforged, there are many options for customizing trainers such as battle rules, dialogue, drops, and teams; however, these features by themselves can be very limiting for server owners who may want far more customizability. One common option many take is using the Trainer Commands sidemod to run commands to perform actions during common battle or interaction events; however this only allows them to perform actions that can be done through commands, and nothing more. This mod seeks to expand on that and provide far more customizability using a Pure Forge approach for wider usage.
</p>
<hr>
<h3>Features</h3>


<p>
<strong>Instanced Battles (Mandatory): </strong>Starting a battle with a trainer starts a battle with an invisible cloned copy of the trainer which deletes itself at the end of the battle. This allows for multiple people to be battling the same trainer at the same time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Conditional Drops: </strong>Allows a server/staff member to add an item OR command with a drop rate (1-100%) to a trainer. This can be done individually in game or defined as a preset group within the configuration files.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Team Shuffling: </strong>Allows for a trainer to shuffle teams defined in the mod’s configuration files.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Checkpoints: </strong>Prevents someone from fighting a trainer unless they have the defined access tag AND/OR rewards someone an access tag upon beating a trainer. This allows for potential gatekeeping or progression in servers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Commands: </strong>Replicates trainer commands with a more user friendly command structure. (Note: This mod and trainer commands do not mix well together when on the same trainer, hence why this feature is necessary).
</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>


<p>
*Note: To use this mod, you need both the latest version of Pixelmon Reforged for MC 1.16.5 and at least Minecraft Forge (Version: 36.2.34).
</p>
<ol>

<li>After downloading the mod, place it within your mods folder. (Note: mods folder NOT plugins folder). 

<li>Start your server. If everything works fine, your server should start up with no problems, and the default configuration files should generate in the /config/CloverTrainerUtils folder.

<li>Log in to your server and pick an NPC trainer of your choice and run the command, “/tutils init”.

<li>Congratulations! You’ve set up your first trainer for this mod. To see further information on what else you can do, you can use “/tutils about” to see all commands, or further check this documentation.
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Configuration</h3>


<h4>Conditional Drop Presets</h4>


<p>
The conditional drops configuration file can be found in the /config/CloverTrainerUtils/conddrops folder. Within the json file, multiple different presets can be defined under the map called, “presets”. The name given is what is needed to use when using the preset command. In Example 1, for example, this is “example”
</p>
<p>
Each preset functions as a list containing multiple drop objects. These drop objects consist of four fields which are type, data, prob, and quantity.
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>type
   </td>
   <td>Can either be item or cmd, which indicate whether the drop is an item or a command.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>data
   </td>
   <td>When type is item, data is the item’s id such as “pixelmon:master_ball”
<p>
When type is cmd, data is the command itself such as “say Hello World!”
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>prob
   </td>
   <td>The probability in percentage of the drop happening. It can only be from 1-100
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>quantity
   </td>
   <td>The amount of the item given or the amount of times the command is run.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


<h5>Example 1</h5>





<pre class="prettyprint">{
  "presets": {
    "example": [
      {
        "type": "item",
        "data": "pixelmon:great_ball",
        "prob": 100,
        "quantity": 5
      },
      {
        "type": "cmd",
        "data": "say Hello World!",
        "prob": 100,
        "quantity": 1
      }
    ]
  }
}
</pre>


<h4>Team Shuffler</h4>


<p>
The team shuffler configuration files can be found in the /config/CloverTrainerUtils/shuffler folder. The files consist of two config files. The pokemon.json file is used to define the pokemon that can be used in a team, and the teams.json is used to connect the ids from the pokemon.json with a team id to be used with shuffler commands.
</p>
<h5>Pokemon Configuration</h5>


<p>
Within the pokemon.json, all pokemon objects are defined within the “pokemon” map. In Example 2 examples of these pokemon objects are labeled “example1”  and  “example2”. Each has a variety of fields to create the pokemon.
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Field</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Description</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>species
   </td>
   <td>The species name of the pokemon.

  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>ivs
   </td>
   <td>A list of the pokemon’s ivs from 0-31 in the order of Hp, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>evs
   </td>
   <td>A list of the pokemon’s ivs from 0-252 in the order of Hp, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed.

<h5>Teams Configuration</h5>


<p>
Within the json file, multiple different teams can be defined under the map called, “teams”. The name given is what is needed to use when using the shuffler command. In Example 3, for example, this is “exampleteam”. Within “exampleteam”, up to six slots can be with the contents of each slot being the id of the pokemon object within the pokemon.json file.
</p>
